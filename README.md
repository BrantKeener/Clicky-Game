# Clicky-Game
*A react memory app that requires the user to click unique pictures.*

**Clicky-Game** is a memory card game based on the excellent science fiction series [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/). If you haven't started watching it yet, check it out on Amazon Prime!
The user is immediately greeted with a modal that gives them a rundown on how to play the game.

## Features

Clicky-Game features a fun card-flipping animation with rich backgrounds, and a color palette derived from the universe of The Expanse. All cards are related to the show's characters, with gifs pulled from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) to help give the app an even more game-like feel. The game monitor's user's current and high schores for this session. The app also montiors the cards such that if a duplicate card is chosen, a loss condition is thrown, while if 12 correct cards are chosen wihtout duplication, a win condition is thrown.
